               <b>VARIABES</b> 
               <br>
                Variables are named values and can store any type of JavaScript value.
                <br><br>
                Here’s how to declare a variable:
                <br>
                <b>EXAMPLE:</b><br><br>
                let x = "Hello universe";
                <br><br>
                <b>And here’s what’s happening in the example above:</b>
                <br> 
                 - let is the keyword that tells JavaScript you’re declaring a variable.<br>
                 - x is the name of that variable.<br>
                 - = is the operator that tells JavaScript a value is coming up next.<br>
                 - "Hello universe" is the value for the variable to store.<br>
                <br><br>
                In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables: 
                <br>using the var, let, and const keywords. Each keyword has its own characteristics and scope rules. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Here are examples of each type of variable declaration:</b>
                <br>
                <b>let </b>declaration:<br>
                The let keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provides block-scoping, allowing variables to be limited to 
                <br>the nearest enclosing block (commonly a pair of curly braces {}).<br> Variables declared with let can be reassigned later within their scope.
                <br><b>EXAMPLE: </b><br>
                let x = 10;<br>
                console.log(x); 
                <br>
                <br>Output: 10
                <br><br>
                <b>const</b> declaration:
                <br>The const keyword also appeared in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare constants that cannot be reassigned.
                <br> Like let, const is also block-scoped.
                <br><br>
                const x = 10;<br>
                <b>EXAMPLE: </b><br>
                console.log(x);
                <br><br>
                Output: 10
                <br>
                x = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
                <br><br>
                <b>var</b> declaration:
                <br>The var keyword has been traditionally used for variable declaration in JavaScript, but it has some quirks and scoping issues. 
                <br>Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the function they are declared in or at the global scope if declared outside of any function.
                <br>
                <b>EXAMPLE: </b>
                <br><br>
                // Function-scoped variable
                <br>  function example() {
                    <br>var x = 10;
                    <br>console.log(x); 
                    <br>
                    Output: 10
                    <br>
                }<br>
                console.log(x); 
                <br>// Error: x is not defined (not accessible outside the function)
                <br><br><br>
                Overall, it is recommended to use<b> let and const</b> instead of var to avoid scoping issues and to have more predictable code behavior. 
                <br>The choice between let and const depends on whether you need to reassign the variable or if you want to ensure its immutability.
